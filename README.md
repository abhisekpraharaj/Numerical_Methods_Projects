# Numerical_Methods_Projects
This Repository contains some ipynb files in which some real world problems are solved analytically and graphically using Numerical_Methods.Then the values obtained from both numerical method and manually method are compared to find out how good those methods are to solve those problems.
The data_analytical_final file is for the simple pendulum motion data file which contains the manually calulated values.
The observational_projectile pdf gives the observational or experimental values for a projectile motion used to check succesive bisection (Numerical_Method) Method.
